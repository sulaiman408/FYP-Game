# FYP
# Ive used Unity 2019.1.2f1 (64 bit) for this project. And it wont run on any other versions. because of versions compatibility on unity. 
# All the code and classes of codes are stored in assets/scripts. 
# All the models are stored in Assets/models. Some of the models and icons ive used are for testing and development phase only.Not finished product. 
# Ive set the goal node on just one move for testing purposes only.It can be moved to any of the node on any grid just by by using checkmark in unity interface.
